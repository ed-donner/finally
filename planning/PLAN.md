# FinAlly — AI Trading Workstation

## Project Specification

## 1. Vision

FinAlly (Finance Ally) is a visually stunning AI-powered trading workstation that streams live market data, lets users trade a simulated portfolio, and integrates an LLM chat assistant that can analyze positions and execute trades on the user's behalf. It looks and feels like a modern Bloomberg terminal with an AI copilot.

This is the capstone project for an agentic AI coding course. It is built entirely by Coding Agents demonstrating how orchestrated AI agents can produce a production-quality full-stack application. Agents interact through files in `planning/`.

## 2. User Experience

### First Launch

The user runs a single Docker command (or a provided start script). A browser opens to `http://localhost:8000`. No login, no signup. They immediately see:

- A watchlist of 10 default tickers, which legendary investor Warren Buffett would approve for investing now, with live-updating prices in a grid
- $10,000 in virtual cash
- A dark, data-rich trading terminal aesthetic
- An AI chat panel ready to assist

### What the User Can Do

- **Watch prices stream** — prices flash green (uptick) or red (downtick) with subtle CSS animations that fade
- **View sparkline mini-charts** — price action beside each ticker in the watchlist, accumulated on the frontend from the SSE stream since page load (sparklines fill in progressively)
- **Click a ticker** to see a larger detailed chart in the main chart area, populated from SSE price history accumulated since page load
- **Buy and sell shares** — market orders only, instant fill at current price, no fees, no confirmation dialog
- **Monitor their portfolio** — a heatmap (treemap) showing positions sized by weight and colored by P&L, plus a P&L chart tracking total portfolio value over time
- **View a positions table** — ticker, quantity, average cost, current price, unrealized P&L, % change
- **Chat with the AI assistant** — ask about their portfolio, get analysis, and have the AI execute trades and manage the watchlist through natural language
- **Manage the watchlist** — add/remove tickers manually or via the AI chat

### Visual Design

- **Dark theme**: backgrounds around `#0d1117` or `#1a1a2e`, muted gray borders, no pure black
- **Price flash animations**: brief green/red background highlight on price change, fading over ~500ms via CSS transitions
- **Connection status indicator**: a small colored dot (green = connected, yellow = reconnecting, red = disconnected) visible in the header
- **Professional, data-dense layout**: inspired by Bloomberg/trading terminals — every pixel earns its place
- **Responsive but desktop-first**: optimized for wide screens, functional on tablet

### Color Scheme
- Accent Yellow: `#ecad0a`
- Blue Primary: `#209dd7`
- Purple Secondary: `#753991` (submit buttons)

## 3. Architecture Overview

### Single Container, Single Port

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, built as a static export (`output: 'export'`), served by FastAPI as static files
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), managed as a `uv` project
- **Database**: SQLite, single file at `db/finally.db`, volume-mounted for persistence
- **Real-time data**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) — simpler than WebSockets, one-way server→client push, works everywhere
- **AI integration**: LiteLLM → OpenRouter (Cerebras for fast inference), with structured outputs for trade execution
- **Market data**: Environment-variable driven — simulator by default, real data via Massive API if key provided

### Why These Choices

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| SSE over WebSockets | One-way push is all we need; simpler, no bidirectional complexity, universal browser support |
| Static Next.js export | Single origin, no CORS issues, one port, one container, simple deployment |
| SQLite over Postgres | No auth = no multi-user = no need for a database server; self-contained, zero config |
| Single Docker container | Students run one command; no docker-compose for production, no service orchestration |
| uv for Python | Fast, modern Python project management; reproducible lockfile; what students should learn |
| Market orders only | Eliminates order book, limit order logic, partial fills — dramatically simpler portfolio math |

### Key Boundaries

- **`frontend/`** is a self-contained Next.js project. It knows nothing about Python. It talks to the backend via `/api/*` endpoints and `/api/stream/*` SSE endpoints. Internal structure is up to the Frontend Engineer agent.
- **`backend/`** is a self-contained uv project with its own `pyproject.toml`. It owns all server logic including database initialization, schema, seed data, API routes, SSE streaming, market data, and LLM integration. Internal structure is up to the Backend/Market Data agents.
- **`backend/db/`** contains schema SQL definitions and seed logic. The backend lazily initializes the database on first request — creating tables and seeding default data if the SQLite file doesn't exist or is empty.
- **`db/`** at the top level is the runtime volume mount point. The SQLite file (`db/finally.db`) is created here by the backend and persists across container restarts via Docker volume.
- **`planning/`** contains project-wide documentation, including this plan. All agents reference files here as the shared contract.
- **`test/`** contains Playwright E2E tests and supporting infrastructure (e.g., `docker-compose.test.yml`). Unit tests live within `frontend/` and `backend/` respectively, following each framework's conventions.
- **`scripts/`** contains start/stop scripts that wrap Docker commands.

## 5. Environment Variables

```bash
# Required only when LLM_MOCK=false
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here

# Optional: Massive (Polygon.io) API key for real market data
# If not set, the built-in market simulator is used (recommended for most users)
MASSIVE_API_KEY=

# Optional: Set to "true" for deterministic mock LLM responses (testing)
LLM_MOCK=false
```

### Behavior

- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is set and non-empty → backend uses Massive REST API for market data
- If `MASSIVE_API_KEY` is absent or empty → backend uses the built-in market simulator
- If `LLM_MOCK=true` → backend returns deterministic mock LLM responses (for E2E tests), and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is not required
- If `LLM_MOCK=false` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is absent or empty → backend startup should fail fast with a clear configuration error
- The backend reads `.env` from the project root (mounted into the container or read via docker `--env-file`)

---

## 6. Market Data

### Two Implementations, One Interface

Both the simulator and the Massive client implement the same abstract interface. The backend selects which to use based on the environment variable. All downstream code (SSE streaming, price cache, frontend) is agnostic to the source.

### Simulator (Default)

- Generates prices using geometric Brownian motion (GBM) with configurable drift and volatility per ticker
- Updates at ~500ms intervals
- Correlated moves across tickers (e.g., tech stocks move together)
- Occasional random "events" — sudden 2-5% moves on a ticker for drama
- Starts from realistic seed prices (e.g., AAPL ~$190, GOOGL ~$175, etc.)
- Runs as an in-process background task — no external dependencies
- The seed price at startup is stored as the synthetic **previous close** for each ticker, used to compute daily change %

### Massive API (Optional)

- REST API polling (not WebSocket) — simpler, works on all tiers
- Polls for the union of all watched tickers on a configurable interval
- Free tier (5 calls/min): poll every 15 seconds
- Paid tiers: poll every 2-15 seconds depending on tier
- Parses REST response into the same format as the simulator

### Shared Price Cache

- A single background task (simulator or Massive poller) writes to an in-memory price cache
- The cache holds the following per ticker: latest price, previous price (last tick, for flash direction), previous close (session-start seed or API-provided, for daily change %), and timestamp
- SSE streams read from this cache and push updates to connected clients
- This architecture supports future multi-user scenarios without changes to the data layer

### SSE Streaming

- Endpoint: `GET /api/stream/prices`
- Long-lived SSE connection; client uses native `EventSource` API
- Server pushes price updates **only when a price changes**, for **watchlist tickers only** — events are not repeated if prices are unchanged (e.g., between Massive API polls)
- The protocol uses named SSE events so frontend and backend share one contract:
  - `snapshot` — sent immediately after connection opens, containing the full current watchlist payload so the UI does not render empty prices/charts while waiting for the next tick
  - `price` — sent whenever a watched ticker changes price
  - `watchlist` — sent after add/remove actions so the existing connection becomes watchlist-aware without reconnecting
  - `heartbeat` — sent every ~15 seconds when no other events are emitted, allowing the client to distinguish an idle stream from a dead one
- `snapshot` payload:
  - `tickers`: array of `{ticker, price, previous_price, previous_close, change_pct, timestamp, direction}`
- `price` payload:
  - `ticker`, `price`, `previous_price`, `previous_close`, `change_pct` (daily, vs previous close), `timestamp`, and `direction` (`"up"` | `"down"`)
- `watchlist` payload:
  - `action` (`"added"` | `"removed"`), `ticker`, and `watchlist` (the full updated ticker list)
- The SSE stream is **watchlist-aware**: when the user adds or removes a ticker, the backend dynamically updates which tickers are streamed on the existing connection and emits a `watchlist` event — no reconnect needed
- Client handles reconnection automatically (EventSource has built-in retry)

---

## 7. Database

### SQLite with Lazy Initialization

The backend checks for the SQLite database on startup (or first request). If the file doesn't exist or tables are missing, it creates the schema and seeds default data. This means:

- No separate migration step
- No manual database setup
- Fresh Docker volumes start with a clean, seeded database automatically

### Schema

All tables include a `user_id` column defaulting to `"default"`. This is hardcoded for now (single-user) but enables future multi-user support without schema migration.

**users_profile** — User state (cash balance)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (default: `"default"`)
- `cash_balance` REAL (default: `10000.0`)
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**watchlist** — Tickers the user is watching
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `added_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`

**positions** — Current holdings (one row per ticker per user)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `avg_cost` REAL
- `updated_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)
- UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, ticker)`
- Note: selling all shares sets `quantity` to 0 — the row is **not deleted**. The frontend filters out zero-quantity rows from the positions table and heatmap display.
- When a position is sold down to zero, `avg_cost` is reset to `0`. A later buy in the same ticker creates a fresh cost basis from scratch rather than reusing historical average cost.

**trades** — Trade history (append-only log)
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `ticker` TEXT
- `side` TEXT (`"buy"` or `"sell"`)
- `quantity` REAL (fractional shares supported)
- `price` REAL
- `executed_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**portfolio_snapshots** — Portfolio value over time (for P&L chart). Recorded every 30 seconds by a background task, and immediately after each trade execution.
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `total_value` REAL
- `recorded_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

**chat_messages** — Conversation history with LLM
- `id` TEXT PRIMARY KEY (UUID)
- `user_id` TEXT (default: `"default"`)
- `role` TEXT (`"user"` or `"assistant"`)
- `content` TEXT
- `actions` TEXT (JSON — trades executed, watchlist changes made; null for user messages). The frontend reads this field to render inline confirmations (e.g. "Bought 5 AAPL @ $191.20") directly in the chat bubble for the assistant's message.
- `created_at` TEXT (ISO timestamp)

### Default Seed Data

- One user profile: `id="default"`, `cash_balance=10000.0`
- Ten watchlist entries: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, JPM, V, NFLX

## 8. API Endpoints

### Market Data
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/stream/prices` | SSE stream of live price updates |

### Portfolio
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/portfolio` | Current positions, cash balance, total value, unrealized P&L |
| POST | `/api/portfolio/trade` | Execute a trade: `{ticker, quantity, side}` |
| GET | `/api/portfolio/history` | Portfolio value snapshots over time (for P&L chart) |

**`GET /api/portfolio` response shape:**
```json
{
  "cash_balance": 8432.50,
  "total_value": 12847.30,
  "positions": [
    {
      "ticker": "AAPL",
      "quantity": 10,
      "avg_cost": 189.50,
      "current_price": 193.20,
      "market_value": 1932.00,
      "unrealized_pnl": 37.00,
      "pnl_pct": 1.95
    }
  ]
}
```
Only positions with `quantity > 0` are included. `total_value` = `cash_balance` + sum of all `market_value`.

**Trade validation rules** for manual and LLM-driven orders:
- `ticker` is normalized to uppercase and trimmed before validation and persistence
- `ticker` must be in the supported market data universe; unknown symbols are rejected with `400`
- `side` must be exactly `"buy"` or `"sell"`
- `quantity` must parse as a finite positive number greater than `0`
- Fractional shares are supported to at most 4 decimal places; values with higher precision are rejected rather than rounded implicitly
- Buy orders require sufficient cash at the current cached market price
- Sell orders require sufficient owned quantity in the current position
- Validation errors return structured error payloads that the frontend can render inline
- Trade execution is wrapped in a SQLite transaction: cash debit/credit and position update are atomic. Concurrent requests for the same user are serialized via a per-user asyncio lock to prevent double-spend.

### Watchlist
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/watchlist` | Current watchlist tickers with latest prices |
| POST | `/api/watchlist` | Add a ticker: `{ticker}` |
| DELETE | `/api/watchlist/{ticker}` | Remove a ticker |

### Chat
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/chat/history` | Recent chat messages (last 50, chronological order) |
| POST | `/api/chat` | Send a message, receive complete JSON response (message + executed actions) |

**`POST /api/chat` request shape:**
```json
{
  "message": "Buy 5 shares of AAPL and add AMD to my watchlist"
}
```

**`POST /api/chat` response shape:**
```json
{
  "user_message": {
    "id": "uuid-user-message",
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Buy 5 shares of AAPL and add AMD to my watchlist",
    "created_at": "2026-04-13T18:00:00Z"
  },
  "assistant_message": {
    "id": "uuid-assistant-message",
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Bought 5 shares of AAPL and added AMD to your watchlist.",
    "actions": {
      "trades": [
        {
          "ticker": "AAPL",
          "side": "buy",
          "requested_quantity": 5,
          "status": "executed",
          "executed_quantity": 5,
          "executed_price": 191.2,
          "trade_id": "uuid-trade",
          "error": null
        }
      ],
      "watchlist_changes": [
        {
          "ticker": "AMD",
          "action": "add",
          "status": "executed",
          "error": null
        }
      ]
    },
    "created_at": "2026-04-13T18:00:01Z"
  },
  "portfolio": {
    "cash_balance": 9044.0,
    "total_value": 10000.0,
    "positions": []
  },
  "watchlist": ["AAPL", "AMD", "AMZN"]
}
```

Response contract notes:
- The backend persists the user message first, then executes requested actions, then persists the assistant message with final action results
- `assistant_message.actions` always reflects post-execution results, not raw LLM intent
- Partial failure is allowed: some actions may be `executed` while others are `rejected`
- `portfolio` and `watchlist` reflect post-execution state so the frontend can reconcile immediately without an additional fetch

### System
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check (for Docker/deployment) |

## 9. LLM Integration

When writing code to make calls to LLMs, use cerebras skill to use LiteLLM via OpenRouter to the `openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-120b` model with Cerebras as the inference provider. Structured Outputs should be used to interpret the results.

There is an OPENROUTER_API_KEY in the .env file in the project root.

### How It Works

When the user sends a chat message, the backend:

1. Loads the user's current portfolio context (cash, positions with P&L, watchlist with live prices, total portfolio value)
2. Loads recent conversation history from the `chat_messages` table (truncated to the last ~1024 tokens to bound context window cost)
3. Constructs a prompt with a system message, portfolio context, conversation history, and the user's new message
4. Calls the LLM via LiteLLM → OpenRouter, requesting structured output, using the cerebras skill
5. Parses the complete structured JSON response
6. Auto-executes any trades or watchlist changes specified in the response
7. Stores the message and executed actions in `chat_messages`
8. Returns the complete JSON response to the frontend (no token-by-token streaming — Cerebras inference is fast enough that a loading indicator is sufficient)

### Structured Output Schema

The LLM is instructed to respond with JSON matching this schema:

```json
{
  "message": "Your conversational response to the user",
  "trades": [
    {"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 10}
  ],
  "watchlist_changes": [
    {"ticker": "PYPL", "action": "add"}
  ]
}
```

- `message` (required): The conversational text shown to the user
- `trades` (optional): Array of trades to auto-execute. Each trade goes through the same validation as manual trades, including ticker normalization, supported-symbol checks, positive finite quantity, max 4 decimal places, sufficient cash for buys, and sufficient shares for sells
- `watchlist_changes` (optional): Array of watchlist modifications. `action` must be `"add"` or `"remove"` — no other values are valid

### Auto-Execution

Trades specified by the LLM execute automatically — no confirmation dialog. This is a deliberate design choice:
- It's a simulated environment with fake money, so the stakes are zero
- It creates an impressive, fluid demo experience
- It demonstrates agentic AI capabilities — the core theme of the course

If a trade or watchlist change fails validation (e.g., insufficient cash or duplicate watchlist add), the backend still returns the assistant message but marks the individual action `status="rejected"` with an `error` string. The HTTP response remains `200` unless the overall request is malformed.

### System Prompt Guidance

The LLM should be prompted as "FinAlly, an AI trading assistant" with instructions to:
- Analyze portfolio composition, risk concentration, and P&L
- Suggest trades with reasoning
- Execute trades when the user asks or agrees
- Manage the watchlist proactively
- Be concise and data-driven in responses
- Always respond with valid structured JSON

### LLM Mock Mode

When `LLM_MOCK=true`, the backend returns the following deterministic mock response regardless of input:

```json
{
  "message": "I've reviewed your portfolio. To get you started, I'll buy 5 shares of AAPL.",
  "trades": [
    {"ticker": "AAPL", "side": "buy", "quantity": 5}
  ],
  "watchlist_changes": []
}
```

If the mock trade fails validation (e.g. insufficient cash), the backend still returns the mock `message` but includes an `error` field on the failed trade entry so the frontend can display it inline.

This fixed response enables:
- Fast, free, reproducible E2E tests (trade execution and message rendering are both exercised)
- Development without an API key
- CI/CD pipelines

---

## 10. Frontend Design

### Layout

The frontend is a single-page application with a dense, terminal-inspired layout. The specific component architecture and layout system is up to the Frontend Engineer, but the UI should include these elements:

- **Watchlist panel** — grid/table of watched tickers with: ticker symbol, current price (flashing green/red on change), daily change %, and a sparkline mini-chart (accumulated from SSE since page load)
- **Main chart area** — larger chart for the currently selected ticker, with at minimum price over time. Clicking a ticker in the watchlist selects it here.
- **Portfolio heatmap** — treemap visualization where each rectangle is a position, sized by portfolio weight, colored by P&L (green = profit, red = loss)
- **P&L chart** — line chart showing total portfolio value over time, using data from `portfolio_snapshots`
- **Positions table** — tabular view of all positions: ticker, quantity, avg cost, current price, unrealized P&L, % change
- **Trade bar** — simple input area: ticker field, quantity field (supports fractional shares, e.g. 0.5), buy button, sell button. Market orders, instant fill. Clicking a ticker in the watchlist auto-populates the ticker field.
- **AI chat panel** — docked/collapsible sidebar. Message input, scrolling conversation history, loading indicator while waiting for LLM response. Trade executions and watchlist changes shown inline as confirmations.
- **Header** — portfolio total value (updating live), connection status indicator, cash balance

### Technical Notes

- Use `EventSource` for SSE connection to `/api/stream/prices`
- Use **Lightweight Charts** (TradingView's open-source library) for all charts: sparklines, main ticker chart, and P&L chart. Do not use Recharts.
- Price flash effect: on receiving a new price, briefly apply a CSS class with background color transition, then remove it
- When SSE is disconnected: watchlist prices freeze, text turns a muted grey, and a "stale" label is shown per row. Normal styling is restored on reconnection.
- All API calls go to the same origin (`/api/*`) — no CORS configuration needed
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom dark theme

---

## 11. Docker & Deployment

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile

```
Stage 1: Node 20 slim
  - Copy frontend/
  - npm install && npm run build (produces static export)

Stage 2: Python 3.12 slim
  - Install uv
  - Copy backend/
  - uv sync (install Python dependencies from lockfile)
  - Copy frontend build output into a static/ directory
  - Expose port 8000
  - CMD: uvicorn serving FastAPI app
```

FastAPI serves the static frontend files and all API routes on port 8000.

### Docker Volume

The SQLite database persists via a bind mount from the repo's top-level `db/` directory:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)/db:/app/db" -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env finally
```

The `db/` directory in the project root is the single source of truth for runtime persistence in local development and test runs. It maps to `/app/db` in the container, and the backend writes `finally.db` to this path. This keeps the SQLite file inspectable from the host and avoids ambiguity between bind mounts and named volumes.

### Start/Stop Scripts

**`scripts/start_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Builds the Docker image if not already built (or if `--build` flag passed)
- Runs the container with the bind mount to `./db`, port mapping, and `.env` file
- Prints the URL to access the app
- Optionally opens the browser

**`scripts/stop_mac.sh`** (macOS/Linux):
- Stops and removes the running container
- Does NOT remove the volume (data persists)

**`scripts/start_windows.ps1`** / **`scripts/stop_windows.ps1`**: PowerShell equivalents for Windows.

All scripts should be idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

### Optional Cloud Deployment

The container is designed to deploy to AWS App Runner, Render, or any container platform. A Terraform configuration for App Runner may be provided in a `deploy/` directory as a stretch goal, but is not part of the core build.

---

## 12. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (within `frontend/` and `backend/`)

**Backend (pytest)**:
- Market data: simulator generates valid prices, GBM math is correct, Massive API response parsing works, both implementations conform to the abstract interface
- Portfolio: trade execution logic, P&L calculations, edge cases (selling more than owned, buying with insufficient cash, selling at a loss)
- Portfolio: zero-quantity position handling and average-cost reset on re-entry
- LLM: structured output parsing handles all valid schemas, graceful handling of malformed responses, trade validation within chat flow
- API routes: correct status codes, response shapes, error handling

**Frontend (React Testing Library or similar)**:
- Component rendering with mock data
- Price flash animation triggers correctly on price changes
- Watchlist CRUD operations
- Portfolio display calculations
- Chat message rendering and loading state

### E2E Tests (in `test/`)

**Infrastructure**: A separate `docker-compose.test.yml` in `test/` that spins up the app container plus a Playwright container. This keeps browser dependencies out of the production image.

**Environment**: Tests run with `LLM_MOCK=true` by default for speed and determinism.

**Key Scenarios**:
- Fresh start: default watchlist appears, $10k balance shown, prices are streaming
- Add and remove a ticker from the watchlist
- Buy shares: cash decreases, position appears, portfolio updates
- Sell shares: cash increases, position quantity updates (zero-quantity rows are filtered from display)
- Portfolio visualization: heatmap renders with correct colors, P&L chart has data points
- AI chat (mocked): send a message, receive a response, trade execution appears inline
- SSE resilience: disconnect and verify reconnection
- SSE protocol: initial `snapshot` arrives on connect, `watchlist` events arrive after add/remove, and the UI recovers cleanly after heartbeat gaps/reconnect
